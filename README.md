# üöÄ Async Performance Comparison with `ConfigureAwait(false)` üéØ

Welcome to this fun and engaging experiment where we explore the **real-world impact** of using `ConfigureAwait(false)` in asynchronous methods! Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or just curious about .NET async programming, this project gives a hands-on demonstration of how `ConfigureAwait(false)` affects performance in simple and complex scenarios. üòé

### ü§ñ What is this?

This is a console application built in .NET Core, which benchmarks the performance of asynchronous methods **with** and **without** the usage of `ConfigureAwait(false)`. You‚Äôll see both simple and more complex use cases, like downloading web content and parsing HTML. 

Check out the full context and the background of `ConfigureAwait(false)` in [this amazing article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/) by the .NET team!

### üí° Why would I want to use `ConfigureAwait(false)`?

This question is actually covered in depth in the blog post [ConfigureAwait FAQ](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/). Here's a quick summary from the **‚ÄúWhy would I want to use ConfigureAwait(false)?‚Äù** section:
- In **non-UI** applications (like ASP.NET Core, or in our case, a console app), there‚Äôs **no need** to return to the original context after an `await` operation.
- Using `ConfigureAwait(false)` in **"hot paths"** (highly used code) **reduces overhead**, because we can skip the checks for `SynchronizationContext` and `TaskScheduler`, saving precious milliseconds! ‚è±Ô∏è
- It helps avoid blocking the main thread and allows **better use of system resources** by running continuations on any available thread. üßµ

That‚Äôs why we *would* want to use `ConfigureAwait(false)`, but as we found out during our tests, its actual impact can vary depending on the scenario!

### üß™ What did we discover?

Through our experiments, we found some *interesting* and unexpected results:

1. **Simple scenarios** (e.g., basic HTTP requests) didn‚Äôt show a significant performance boost from `ConfigureAwait(false)`. In fact, there were cases where performance with `ConfigureAwait(false)` was **slightly slower**. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2. **Complex scenarios** (e.g., downloading and parsing HTML) with parallel tasks showed more noticeable differences, but the performance gain was still relatively small. üíº
3. **Multithreaded environments**: `ConfigureAwait(false)` shines when you have a lot of parallel tasks, especially in **server-side apps** where you don‚Äôt need to go back to the original context, and you want to keep things **non-blocking**.
   
> ‚ú® **Surprise twist**: Even in parallel, highly concurrent workloads, the overhead of `ConfigureAwait(false)` was minimal in our tests. We suspect this is because the application is CPU-bound by I/O operations like HTTP requests and HTML parsing, and context-switching overhead was not the primary bottleneck.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to run this project

Make sure you have .NET Core installed on your machine. Then, clone this repo and run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/async-configureawait-experiment
cd async-configureawait-experiment
dotnet run
```

The program will run several tests, including:
- **Simple HTTP requests** with and without `ConfigureAwait(false)`.
- **Complex scenarios** where we download and parse HTML content from multiple URLs in parallel.

The results will show the performance difference in **milliseconds**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è What's in the code?

1. **Simple methods**:
   - `DownloadWithoutConfigureAwait`: A basic HTTP request without using `ConfigureAwait(false)`.
   - `DownloadWithConfigureAwait`: A basic HTTP request **with** `ConfigureAwait(false)`.

2. **Complex methods**:
   - `DownloadAndParseWithoutConfigureAwait`: Downloading and parsing HTML from multiple URLs **without** `ConfigureAwait(false)`.
   - `DownloadAndParseWithConfigureAwait`: Same as above, but **with** `ConfigureAwait(false)`.

3. **Performance measurement**: 
   - `MeasurePerformance`: This method takes a delegate for an asynchronous method and measures its performance over multiple iterations and parallel tasks. It calculates the total time taken for all tasks.

### üîç Key Insights:

- **Console apps** or **backend server applications** (like ASP.NET Core) are where you get the **most benefit** from `ConfigureAwait(false)`.
- In **UI applications** (like WPF or WinForms), avoid `ConfigureAwait(false)` unless you *really* don‚Äôt need to update the UI after an await operation.
- Not all async code is equal ‚Äî in I/O-bound tasks, `ConfigureAwait(false)` might not have a big impact. However, in complex multithreaded scenarios, it can prevent **blocking** and **boost concurrency**! üöÄ

### üì¶ Dependencies

Before running this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **.NET Core SDK**: You‚Äôll need the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine to run the application. You can download it from the official [Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- **HtmlAgilityPack**: This library is used to parse HTML content in the more complex methods. You can install it via NuGet:
  ```bash
  dotnet add package HtmlAgilityPack
  ```
  The app uses this library to extract HTML elements from web pages as part of our performance benchmarking.

### üö® Important Findings

While testing `ConfigureAwait(false)`, we observed some **unexpected slowdowns** in certain scenarios. Let‚Äôs break down where this happened and why:

1. **Simple methods**: 
   - When we used `ConfigureAwait(false)` with simple HTTP requests (like downloading a web page), we actually saw a **slight performance drop**. This is because in **console applications** or in environments without a `SynchronizationContext` (like our test case), `ConfigureAwait(false)` doesn't provide much benefit. Instead, it adds a **tiny overhead** by forcing the continuation to execute on a different thread pool thread, which can slightly slow down execution.
   
2. **Complex methods with parallelism**: 
   - In the case of downloading and parsing multiple URLs in **parallel**, the performance impact of `ConfigureAwait(false)` was **still minimal**. This is likely because the program is bound by network I/O and parsing HTML, which dominate the execution time. The context-switching overhead (which `ConfigureAwait(false)` is supposed to reduce) was not the bottleneck here.

### üîç Key Insight

Despite the general recommendation to use `ConfigureAwait(false)` for performance reasons in non-UI apps, **you won‚Äôt always see a significant performance boost**. In fact, in simple scenarios, it can add unnecessary complexity without real benefits.

However, in more complex, highly concurrent applications‚Äîespecially in **server environments**‚Äî`ConfigureAwait(false)` helps avoid **unwanted context switching**, allowing for **more efficient use of resources**. So always evaluate whether it makes sense to use it depending on the context and workload.
